# PolySolver
Simple app to plot selected x and y coordinates with a bit of calculus added in for good measure. 

## UX
I wanted to keep it very simple and not take away from the objective of the task. Simple colours and easy to read results. 

### Users
Expected users could be anyone who wants to find the equation for a polynomial, or calculate to 0.

## Features
* Shows the coordinates and task answers on the top row, followed by a scatter plot graph with line of best fit.

## Technology Used
* HTML - for the sytructure of the content of the page
* CSS3 - for a little styling that I ddin't use bootstrap for
* Bootstrap - framework for responsiveness and the rest of the styling - as requested in the task
* Git - for version control
* GitHub - to host the repository
* Pycharm - as the IDE
* Python - to do the maths
* Flask - to help the front and backend work together
* Sqlite3 - to store the mock database

## Deployment
I used Github for the deployment.

The process involved:
* Hosting a git repository on GitHub.
* On the Github repository go to the settings page and GitHub Pages section.
* Change source to master branch.
* Link is provided to page.

To deploy your own version:
* Visit the repository [here](https://github.com/bandyp/polysolver)
* Click 'clone' to copy
* Open your IDE
* Type 'git clone https://github.com/bandyp/polysolver.git' in the terminal window of the root directory

## Credits

### Acknowledgments
* At certain points I sought the help of stack overflow and youtube
* W3Schools - for various bits of Python and SQL code
